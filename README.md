# President-face-regocnition-with-open-CV

ðŸ§  President Face Recognition with OpenCV & Haar Cascade
This project uses OpenCV and Haar Cascade Classifiers to detect and recognize the faces of prominent world presidents such as Narendra Modi, Vladimir Putin, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Giorgia Meloni. The system captures real-time video feed from the webcam, detects faces using Haar Cascades, and recognizes the president using trained face data.

ðŸš€ Features

Face recognition using LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram)

Pre-trained on sample images of selected presidents

Simple, fast, and lightweight model using Haar Cascades

Easy to extend with more individuals
